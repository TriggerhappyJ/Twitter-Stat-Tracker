# A Simple Twitter Stat Tracker
Estimates the total tweets send today, this week, and this year.  
`Estimated data based off internetlivestats.com`

Has search for user to see how many tweets were sent by a specific user or with a specific hashtag today and in the last 7 days.


### Libraries Used
**Python**
- `Tweepy 4.10.1` (Twitter api interaction)
- `Flask 2.2.2` (Web server backend)

**Javascript**
- `JQuery 3.6.0` (General use)
- `Numeral.js 2.0.6` (Number formatting)


<sub>I would of liked to of used twitter-api-v2 javascript library to not of had to rely on a python backend but became to complicated to implement so stuck with tweepy for twitter api interaction</sub>
